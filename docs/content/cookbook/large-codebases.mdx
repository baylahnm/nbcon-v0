## Large Codebases

Tips for working with large codebases in NBCON PRO.

### Optimization

- Use codebase indexing
- Enable lazy loading
- Configure ignore files

### Performance

```typescript
const config = {
  indexing: {
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    excludePatterns: ['node_modules', 'dist'],
  },
};
```

### Best Practices

- Break large projects into modules
- Use incremental builds
- Leverage caching

### Memory Management

Monitor memory usage and adjust settings as needed.
